                <p>
                    Hey y'all! I'm Jayce Lukaszewicz (don't worry, my last name isn't actually that hard to 
                    pronounce). I'm an artist first and foremost, specializing in 2D illustrations, both digitally
                    and on paper. I have been drawing for over a decade and have most of those drawings still! I also
                    have a cat named Nutmeg!
                </p>

                <p>
                    I am a first-year student at the University of Oregon. I am majoring in Art and Technology and will
                    be graduating in June of 2028 to get my Bachelor's of Science. So far, during my college journey I have
                    created 3 comics, designed a few logos, mascots, and a product box, a cardboard sculpture, 3 soft sculptures,
                    and more, including this website!
                </p>

                <p>
                    If you want to look at my experience and skillset, take a look at my resume! I am actively looking for part-time
                    jobs and would love to join your team.
                </p>

                <p>If you have any recommendations for what I should add to my shop, please let me know by emailing me! My email
                    is attached to my resume.
                </p>
